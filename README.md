# Advent of Code 2024

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles released every December by [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/).
This repository contains my solutions to [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024).
I chose Rust as the programming language to write my solutions to improve my Rust skills.
Some codes may use the functional programming features extensively, in order to force myself to get familiar with them.

Two puzzles are posted each day in the Advent calendar.
The solution to each puzzle is placed in a separate subdirectory.
For example, the first puzzle of day 2 is placed in `day02a` and the second puzzle of day 2 is placed in `day02b`.

If you find that the code doesn't work, or you'd like to discuss the code with me, feel free to open an issue in this GitHub repository or email me (kingsley@kkoyung.dev).

Last year, I only completed half of the calendar since I was busy on writing my PhD thesis. This year I will try harder to achieve more puzzles in the calendar.
