# Advent of Code 2024

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles released every December by [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/).
This repository contains my solutions to [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024).
I chose Rust as the programming language to write my solutions to improve my Rust skills.
Some codes may use the functional programming features extensively, in order to force myself to get familiar with them.

The solutions for puzzles are stored in different directories according to the day, e.g. `day01`.
Within the directory of each day, solutions of part 1 and part 2 are placed at `src/bin/part1.rs` and `src/bin/part2.rs`, respectively.
Common parts are placed at `src/lib.rs`.
Examples of input/output are also placed in `src/lib.rs`, and they are used to check the code by using the test modules.

If you find that the code doesn't work, or you'd like to discuss the code with me, feel free to open an issue in this GitHub repository or email me (kingsley@kkoyung.dev).

Last year, I only completed half of the calendar since I was busy on writing my PhD thesis. This year I will try harder to achieve more puzzles in the calendar.
